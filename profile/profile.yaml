summary: "My name is Pseudo Wang. I graduated from York University in October 2022 with a degree in Computer Science.

In the university, I learned a lot of fundamental knowledge about OOP principles, design patterns, web structures, operating system principles, and databases.

Before entering the university, I worked in a startup outsourcing company doing front-end related projects from different companies. In this company, I worked with designers and analyzed the client's needs to achieve the desired results. And this is the place I have gained valuable insight into how a successful company operates.

After get into university, I worked as a contracted data structure lecturer at an off-campus tutoring institution. I have helped many students achieve topping 10% grades in the Java Data Structures and Algorithms course.

I have finished multiple paid website works independently in my career path. Those projects involve different back-end technologies (Node.js/Flask/Nginx) and different cloud services (AWS/Azure/Oracle Cloud). You can find a self-build combined website framework on my GitHub using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, also practice projects of Angular and React starting a couple of years ago. Based on interest, I have also made an internet-based Android App using Android Studio in my spare time. Recently, I used GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions to build an auto-deployed web page involving CI/CD workflows.

I am a self-starter and motivated team player with the ability to accomplish tasks independently. Through my work experience and other professional activities, I have strengthened my interpersonal and presentation skills."

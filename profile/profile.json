  "summary": "My name is Pseudo Wang. I graduated from York University in October 2022 with a degree in Computer Science. Before entering the university, I worked in a startup company called Emerge Labs doing front-end related projects for different customers. In this company, I learned to communicate commercially with customers and colleagues and to cooperate with other technicians. After getting into university, I worked as a contracted data structure lecturer at an off-campus tutoring institution called Future Up. In this process, I significantly improved my explanatory skills to better help my students understand the content. I am a self-starter and motivated team player with the ability to accomplish tasks independently. Also, with reliable communication ability and strong coding skills, I'm always the team leader in various projects. Now I'm working with Jarvis and continue learning modern advanced technologies."
